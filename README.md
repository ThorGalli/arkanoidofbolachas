# Arkanoid of Bolachas

 This is an old project of mine... A legacy of my dumb young self.
 
 I didn't know how to use version controll and lost all the source code.

 I cherish this game A LOT, it was the first project I put real effort into...

 This is 100% pure Java, using only native libs.
 
# To run it:

 Simply download and install Java, then download the .jar file and run. 
 
 If you ware concerned running a .jar file:
 
 I scanned the file in virustotal.com >> tinyurl.com/scanofbolachas 
 
 You can still scan it yourself on any virus scan website to doublecheck
 
 The game is a bit hard! Good luck!
